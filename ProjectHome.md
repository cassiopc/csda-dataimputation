Bayesian Network Data Imputation software. A Bayesian network model is learned from incomplete data and then applied to estimate the missing values. The software requires Matlab, including the BNT package of https://github.com/bayesnet/bnt/.

For technical details, we refer to the paper entitled "Bayesian network data imputation with application to survival tree analysis", to appear in the journal Computational Statistics and Data Analysis.

For operational information, please read the help files within the software package. If needed, just write us an email.
